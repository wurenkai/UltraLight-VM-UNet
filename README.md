### Abstract
Traditionally for improving the segmentation performance of models, most approaches prefer to use adding more complex modules. And this is not suitable for the medical field, especially for mobile medical devices, where computationally loaded models are not suitable for real clinical environments due to computational resource constraints. Recently, state-space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have become a strong competitor to traditional CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we deeply explore the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba and propose an UltraLight Vision Mamba UNet (UltraLight VM-UNet) based on this. Specifically, we propose a method for processing features in parallel Vision Mamba, named PVM Layer, which achieves excellent performance with the lowest computational load while keeping the overall number of processing channels constant. We conducted comparisons and ablation experiments with several state-of-the-art lightweight models on three skin lesion public datasets and demonstrated that the UltraLight VM-UNet exhibits the same strong performance competitiveness with parameters of only 0.049M and GFLOPs of 0.060. In addition, this study deeply explores the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba, which will lay a theoretical foundation for Mamba to possibly become a new mainstream module for lightweighting in the future.

### Different Parallel Vision Mamba ï¼ˆPVM Layerï¼‰ settings:
| Setting | Briefly | Params | GFLOPs | DSC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No paralleling ( Channel number ```C```) | 0.136M | 0.060 | 0.9069 |
| 2 | Double parallel ( Channel number ```(C/2)+(C/2)```) | 0.070M | 0.060 |  0.9073 |
| 3 | Quadruple parallel ( Channel number ```(C/4)+(C/4)+(C/4)+(C/4)```) | 0.049M | 0.060 | 0.9091 |

*A. ISIC2017* </br>
1. Download the ISIC 2017 train dataset from [this](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data) link and extract both training dataset and ground truth folders inside the `/data/dataset_isic17/`. </br>
2. Run `Prepare_ISIC2017.py` for data preparation and dividing data to train, validation and test sets. </br>

*B. ISIC2018* </br>
1. Download the ISIC 2018 train dataset from [this](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data) link and extract both training dataset and ground truth folders inside the `/data/dataset_isic18/`. </br>
2. Run `Prepare_ISIC2018.py` for data preparation and dividing data to train, validation and test sets. </br>

*C. PH<sup>2</sup>* </br>
1. Download the PH<sup>2</sup> dataset from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k88qukc20ljnbuo/PH2Dataset.rar) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AEMJKAiORlrwdDi37dRqbqXi6zLmnU3Q/view?usp=sharing) and extract both training dataset and ground truth folders inside the `/data/PH2/`. </br>
2. Run `Prepare_PH2.py` to preprocess the data and form test sets for external validation. </br>

*D. Prepare your own dataset* </br>
1. The file format reference is as follows. (The image is a 24-bit png image. The mask is an 8-bit png image. (0 pixel dots for background, 255 pixel dots for target))
- './your_dataset/'
  - images
    - 0000.png
    - 0001.png
  - masks
    - 0000.png
    - 0001.png
  - Prepare_your_dataset.py
2. In the 'Prepare_your_dataset.py' file, change the number of training sets, validation sets and test sets you want.</br>
3. Run 'Prepare_your_dataset.py'. </br>

**2. Train the UltraLight VM-UNet.** </br>
You can simply run the following command to start training, or download the weights file based on this [issue](https://github.com/wurenkai/UltraLight-VM-UNet/issues/38) before training.
```
python train.py
```
- After trianing, you could obtain the outputs in './results/' </br>

**3. Test the UltraLight VM-UNet.**  
First, in the test.py file, you should change the address of the checkpoint in 'resume_model'.
```
python test.py
```
- After testing, you could obtain the outputs in './results/' </br>

**4. Additional information.** 
- PVM Layer can be very simply embedded into any model to reduce the overall parameters of the model. Please refer to [issue 7](https://github.com/wurenkai/UltraLight-VM-UNet/issues/7) for the methodology of calculating model parameters and GFLOPs. In addition to the above operations, the exact GFLOPs calculation still requires the addition of the SSM values due to the specific nature of SSM. Refer to [here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/110#issuecomment-1919470069) for details. However, due to the small number of UltraLight VM-UNet channels, the addition of all the SSM values has almost no effect on the results of the GFLOPs obtained through the operations described above (3 valid digits).
